# Notes about replicating results

The `replicating_koshkina_paper.ipynb` notebook contains our first few attempts at trying to run the pipeline from the [General Framework Repo](https://github.com/mkoshkina/jersey-number-pipeline). It did not work for various reasons.

However our teammate, [Zhenbang He](https://github.com/m-iDev-0792), fixed most compatibility issues in a forked version of the original repo, which is added as a submodule in this directory.

Furthermore, more commits will be made in his forked repo if there are small changes to the original pipeline that we want to test out.
